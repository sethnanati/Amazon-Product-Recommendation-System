# Recommendation Systems

This project focuses on building a recommendation system using the Amazon product reviews dataset. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products and will be used to extract meaningful insights and build a recommendation system to recommend products to online consumers.

## Context

In today's world, information overload has become a common problem. With the exponential growth of information, consumers often face a dilemma when making choices. Recommender systems play a crucial role in helping consumers by providing personalized recommendations while they browse online. E-commerce websites like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and Etsy invest heavily in developing recommendation models to offer personalized suggestions to their users.

Amazon, for instance, is renowned for its accurate selection of recommendations on its website. Their recommendation system intelligently analyzes and predicts customers' shopping preferences to provide a list of recommended products. One of the baseline recommendation models used by Amazon is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which can handle massive datasets and generate high-quality recommendations in real-time.

## Objective

As a Data Science Manager at Amazon, the objective of this project is to build a recommendation system that recommends products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products. By leveraging the labeled data of Amazon reviews, we aim to extract meaningful insights and develop a recommendation system that enhances the personalized shopping experience for online consumers.

## Dataset

The Amazon dataset includes the following attributes:

- **userId:** Unique identifier for each user
- **productId:** Unique identifier for each product
- **Rating:** The rating given by the user for the corresponding product
- **timestamp:** The time of the rating (not used for this project)

Please note that the dataset does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the recommendation system.

Stay tuned for updates on the progress of this project and the insights gained from the analysis of the Amazon product reviews dataset.
